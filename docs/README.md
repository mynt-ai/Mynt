This repository is a platform to report issues and provide feedback for [Mynt](https://app.usemynt.com) and does not contain the source code ([yet](#future-plans---open-sourcing-mynt)).

Mynt is in beta and may contain bugs and issues - we would love it if you could feedback anything at all about the tool and how it works for you - positive or negative.

To raise an issue or request a feature create a github issue on this repository - thank you for contributing.


## Overview 

Mynt uses AI to generate content based on natural language _'plain english'_ requests (we support many other languages). 

Any part of your document can be edited by the AI with a single chat request. There is no need to highlight text, or place your cursor in a particular position for it to work - simply message the AI and request an addition, alteration or deletion and watch it go. 

Documents Generated in Mynt can be saved, along with your chat history, to your local computer as a .mynt file. These files can then be reopened with Mynt at a later time.

## Future Plans - Open Sourcing Mynt

While we plan and hope to open source Mynt in the near future, we are currently evaluating the potential for reusing some of the code in a commercial venture. As such, the full source code is currently unavailable. We appreciate your interest and patience as we navigate this process.
